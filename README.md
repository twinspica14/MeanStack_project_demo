npm install --save (this will install all libraries necessary for your app)

Decide structure of your app. Like some follow generators like MEAN.IO, MEANjs

The steps could be find everywhere, But depending on structure many different libraries have been generated for ease.

For first Project always go to Firebase by google. To get basic understanding of mongodb and Nodejs.

#starting mongodb locally faces a challenge for the first timers.

First go to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin then in shell or cmd, run mongodb
If problem faced, then mongod --dbpath C:\data --storageEngine=mmapv1  here C:\data\folder  is where db will exist.

in another cmd again go to bin, and run mongo.

This will start the mongodb server.

This project will be updated as I will keep updating in free time.
